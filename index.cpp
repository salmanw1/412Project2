/*! \mainpage Project 2: Load Balancer
 *
 * \section intro_sec My Files
 * I have 3 files for this project: webserver.cpp, request.cpp, and
 * loadbalancer.cpp (index.cpp is for displaying this webpage)
 * The loadbalancer.cpp file holds the main function, running g++
 * loadbalancer.cpp will execute the program creating the log.
 * \n\n
 * \section Load Balancing
 * Using these 3 files this program will be able to handle a high volume
 * of server requests and will manage them efficiently given the
 * parameters: number of webservers and run time.
 * This will show the different servers handling the many requests coming
 * in, distributing the work load across many servers. The servers will be
 * represented by randomly generated IP addresses. The more webservers
 * requested the faster the process will finish, and conversely the less
 * servers requested the longer it will take. The given runtime will
 * determine how many clock cycles the loadbalancer will run. Balancing
 * these two parameters is the key to maximizing request processing
 * efficiency.
